My world is burning, how ‘bout yours?\
The paper plane brought down the jet.\
The flames has ‘lready reached the doors?\
I don’t care enough to sweat.

Come at me, you wild flame!\
Keep the doorknob hot and red.\
I’ve been defeated, b’t there’s no shame!\
I will kill you ‘til you’re dead.

Burn! You soul crushing flame!\
How nobl’ and just you pretend.\
In the end my soul you’ll not claim,\
For I will fight you to the end!

Fuck off with your tiny flame!\
For my victory I will now proclaim!
