Tick, tock, the clock rocked.\
The steady beat behind the ear,\
The quiet rustle of the page.\
Paper after paper, year after year.

The smooth, slick slash of the pen,\
The bright, cold glisten of the ink.\
The subtle, shouted words of the question,\
The sweet, bitter taste of the drink.

The symphony of red ticks,\
The snare roll of the heart,\
The coloured garden of scores,\
The smile of the student smart…

And that was the lie that kept our boat afloat.
