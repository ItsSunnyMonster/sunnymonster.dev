It is a strange surface riddled with lines and blocks.\
Some red, some grey, some green.\
It navigates us through the neighbourhoods\
And reminds us of the places we have been.

Oh! My childhood home: it’s right here. This brown block.\
There’s the little-known restaurant with delicious food.\
The building with the pool I learnt swimming in.\
The riverside square with a picturesque view.

I traced my footsteps —\
The lines of memory,\
Of laughter and tears and screams and blood,\
Etched into the database, as permanently

As the reminiscence of the next nostalgier,\
Etching their new lines of memory, better.
