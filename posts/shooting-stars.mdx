another star fell. as insignificant\
as his bright trail of destruction\
is ephemeral. a few ‘ooh’s\
and nothing more.

i looked up, too late to catch\
his last brightness. stared at the\
blank sky, littered with tiny flames\
i had a small wish that it would’ve been\
me.

i inhaled and exhaled\
but am i really breathing?\
i am naught but a soulless husk\
wandering the land, denied of anything i touched.

even myself.

i have thorns as my claws.\
i roamed and hurt\
everyone.\
you have no idea it hurt me as much as it hurt you!\
except ‘me’ was concealed, naught but a soulless husk\
wandering the skies, denied of everything i hurt.

even myself.

but alas i am not fallen\
i still burnt bright,\
lighting the dark tunnel,\
even if there is no ‘light at the end of it’.

the star that fell:\
behind his beautiful last expression,\
his beautiful last breath,\
was countless eyes red\
and tears shed.\
in his forever oblivion,\
the unfallen dimmed.\
i’ve hurt enough\
i don’t need to extinguish\
your final flame.\
i will keep standing,\
strong, unfallen.

the blank face of the usb shimmered, illuminating my soul.\
i stood, unfallen. i am NOT a soulless husk.
