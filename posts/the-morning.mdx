The sun was not yet out.\
I was already up, running about —\
Seeking the passion of the day ahead;\
‘I want to go’, I said.\
The uncaffeinated morning was a blur;\
Spines resonated with the cold breeze,\
But not without the golden sheen in dreams.

The sky was ice-blue like the air\
Which blew over you, unaware\
Of the warmth and hope on me you beamed.\
So I dreamed…\
The uncaffeinated morning was a blur;\
Spines resonated with the cold breeze,\
But not without the golden sheen in dreams.

We exchanged gazes of ambiguity\
Silent ping-pongs of ‘perhaps, maybe’.\
Am I dreaming in my own psychology\
Or am I missing opportunity after opportunity?\
Are we missing each other? Or is this a fallacy? —

The uncaffeinated morning was a blur;\
Spines resonated with the cold breeze,\
But not without the golden sheen in dreams.

At the end of it, the burning passion left\
Me who, in the heat of the summer, bereft\
Of any warmth. My mind, barren,\
Can only imagine —\
The uncaffeinated morning, a blur;\
Spines resonate with the cold breeze,\
But not without the golden sheen in dreams.

The uncaffeinated morning was blurred;\
Perhaps one day it will be cleared,\
And I will be heard.
