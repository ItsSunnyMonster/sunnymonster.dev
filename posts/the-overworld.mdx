Shivering in the room, fogged outside\
The rain impatiently tapped away at the window\
And their souls to no avail. As they, were locked away\
In nine layers of hell, the nether, lava-hot.

In front of them, the invisible blood-shed,\
The silent screams of pain, fear, fury, and confusion\
Went unnoticed, hidden behind the institutions of ‘greatness’,\
Oh how noble, oh how supreme.

Their words, their notes, their syntax, their silliness\
Flowed endlessly. But who ever sees the source?\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;‘Laziness, weakness, and selfishness’.\
Their pain, their fear, their fury, their confusion\
Vibrated endlessly. But who ever sees the cause?\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;‘Laziness, weakness, and selfishness.’\
Their road, their flight, their way, their journey\
Stretched endlessly. But who ever sees its end?\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;‘Laziness, weakness, and selfishness.’

Then we will stay blind at the river rinsing our road with renewal;\
We will stay mad at our bleak, blank, and bland world, forever unchanging.\
We have failed them! They held what was the key to survival,\
Which now brings them their downfall.

So open your eyes: see them; understand them; help them;\
Be the rainbow they want, be the guide they need.\
Be the friend they miss.\
Unfog their way, undo their self-deprecation, light up their unlit souls.

Let them build their overworld in the nether’s despite,\
Because one day, we will _all_ live in its delight.
